This Excel group project analyzes the Life Ladder (happiness index) across Caucasus countries using statistical methods. We examined how GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, generosity, and freedom to make life choices relate to well-being. The project includes descriptive statistics, correlation analysis for each factor, and multiple regression models (overall and country-specific for Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia) to identify which variables most strongly influence life satisfaction over time.
